**Game character voice lines when your AI coding agent needs attention.**

AI coding agents don't notify you when they finish or need permission. You tab away, lose focus, and waste 15 minutes getting back into flow. peon-ping fixes this with voice lines from Warcraft, StarCraft, Portal, Zelda, and more — works with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, and **OpenCode**.

## Install

```bash
brew install PeonPing/tap/peon-ping
```

Then run `peon-ping-setup` to register hooks and download sound packs. macOS and Linux.

**Or install via curl** (macOS, Linux, WSL2):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.sh | bash
```

One command. Takes 10 seconds. Re-run to update (sounds and config preserved). Installs 10 curated English packs by default.

**Install all packs** (every language and franchise):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --all
```

**Project-local install** — installs into `.claude/` in the current project instead of `~/.claude/`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --local
```

Local installs don't add the `peon` CLI alias or shell completions — use `/peon-ping-toggle` inside Claude Code instead.

## What you'll hear

| Event | CESP Category | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Session starts | `session.start` | *"Ready to work?"*, *"Yes?"*, *"What you want?"* |
| Task finishes | `task.complete` | *"Work, work."*, *"I can do that."*, *"Okie dokie."* |
| Permission needed | `input.required` | *"Something need doing?"*, *"Hmm?"*, *"What you want?"* |
| Rapid prompts (3+ in 10s) | `user.spam` | *"Me busy, leave me alone!"* |

Plus Terminal tab titles (`● project: done`) and desktop notifications when your terminal isn't focused.

peon-ping implements the [Coding Event Sound Pack Specification (CESP)](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon) — an open standard for coding event sounds that any agentic IDE can adopt.

## Quick controls

Need to mute sounds and notifications during a meeting or pairing session? Two options:

| Method | Command | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Slash command** | `/peon-ping-toggle` | While working in Claude Code |
| **CLI** | `peon toggle` | From any terminal tab |

Other CLI commands:

```bash
peon pause                # Mute sounds
peon resume               # Unmute sounds
peon status               # Check if paused or active
peon packs list           # List installed sound packs
peon packs use <name>     # Switch to a specific pack
peon packs next           # Cycle to the next pack
peon packs remove <p1,p2> # Remove specific packs
peon notifications on     # Enable desktop notifications
peon notifications off    # Disable desktop notifications
```

Tab completion is supported — type `peon packs use <TAB>` to see available pack names.

Pausing mutes sounds and desktop notifications instantly. Persists across sessions until you resume. Tab titles remain active when paused.

## Configuration

peon-ping installs a `/peon-ping-toggle` slash command in Claude Code. You can also just ask Claude to change settings for you — e.g. "enable round-robin pack rotation", "set volume to 0.3", or "add glados to my pack rotation". No need to edit config files manually.

The config lives at `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/hooks/peon-ping/config.json` (default: `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/config.json`):

```json
{
  "volume": 0.5,
  "categories": {
    "session.start": true,
    "task.acknowledge": true,
    "task.complete": true,
    "task.error": true,
    "input.required": true,
    "resource.limit": true,
    "user.spam": true
  }
}
```

- **volume**: 0.0–1.0 (quiet enough for the office)
- **desktop_notifications**: `true`/`false` — toggle desktop notification popups independently from sounds (default: `true`)
- **categories**: Toggle individual CESP sound categories on/off (e.g. `"session.start": false` to disable greeting sounds)
- **annoyed_threshold / annoyed_window_seconds**: How many prompts in N seconds triggers the `user.spam` easter egg
- **silent_window_seconds**: Suppress `task.complete` sounds and notifications for tasks shorter than N seconds. (e.g. `10` to only hear sounds for tasks that take longer than 10 seconds)
- **pack_rotation**: Array of pack names (e.g. `["peon", "sc_kerrigan", "peasant"]`). Each session randomly gets one pack from the list and keeps it for the whole session. Leave empty `[]` to use `active_pack` instead.

## Multi-IDE Support

peon-ping works with any agentic IDE that supports hooks. Adapters translate IDE-specific events to the [CESP standard](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon).

| IDE | Status | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Built-in | `curl \| bash` install handles everything |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Adapter | Add `command = "bash ~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/codex.sh"` to `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[notify]` |
| **Cursor** | Adapter | Add hook entries to `~/.cursor/hooks.json` pointing to `adapters/cursor.sh` |
| **OpenCode** | Adapter | `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeonPing/peon-ping/main/adapters/opencode.sh \| bash` |

## Sound packs

40+ packs across Warcraft, StarCraft, Red Alert, Portal, Zelda, Dota 2, Helldivers 2, Elder Scrolls, and more. The default install includes 10 curated English packs:

Install all with `--all`, or switch packs anytime:

```bash
peon packs use glados             # switch to a specific pack
peon packs next                   # cycle to the next pack
peon packs list                   # list all installed packs
```

## Uninstall

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/hooks/peon-ping/uninstall.sh        # global
bash .claude/hooks/peon-ping/uninstall.sh           # project-local
```

## Requirements

- macOS (uses `afplay` and AppleScript), WSL2 (uses PowerShell `MediaPlayer` and WinForms), or Linux (uses `pw-play`/`paplay`/`ffplay`/`mpv`/`aplay` and `notify-send`)
- Claude Code with hooks support
- python3

## How it works

`peon.sh` is a Claude Code hook registered for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `Notification`, and `PermissionRequest` events. On each event it maps to a CESP sound category, picks a random voice line (avoiding repeats), plays it via `afplay` (macOS), PowerShell `MediaPlayer` (WSL2), or `paplay`/`ffplay`/`mpv`/`aplay` (Linux), and updates your Terminal tab title.

Sound packs are downloaded from the [OpenPeon registry](https://github.com/PeonPing/registry) at install time. The official packs are hosted in [PeonPing/og-packs](https://github.com/PeonPing/og-packs). Sound files are property of their respective publishers (Blizzard, Valve, EA, etc.) and are distributed under fair use for personal notification purposes.
