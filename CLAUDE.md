# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. For user-facing documentation (install, configuration, pack list, CLI usage), see [README.md](README.md).

## What This Is

peon-ping plays game character voice lines and sends desktop notifications when AI coding agents need attention. It works with **Claude Code** (built-in), **OpenAI Codex**, **Cursor**, and **OpenCode** via adapters. It handles 5 hook events: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `PermissionRequest`. Written entirely in bash + embedded Python (no npm/node runtime needed).

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (requires bats-core: brew install bats-core)
bats tests/

# Run a single test file
bats tests/peon.bats
bats tests/install.bats

# Run a specific test by name
bats tests/peon.bats -f "plays session.start sound"

# Install locally for development
bash install.sh --local

# Install only specific packs
bash install.sh --packs=peon,glados,peasant
```

There is no build step, linter, or formatter configured for the shell codebase.

## Architecture

### Core Files

- **`peon.sh`** — Main hook script. Receives JSON event data on stdin, routes events via an embedded Python block that handles config loading, event parsing, sound selection, and state management in a single invocation. Shell code then handles async audio playback (`nohup` + background processes) and desktop notifications.
- **`install.sh`** — Installer. Fetches pack registry from GitHub Pages, downloads selected packs, registers hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Falls back to a hardcoded pack list if registry is unreachable.
- **`config.json`** — Default configuration template.

### Event Flow

IDE triggers hook → `peon.sh` reads JSON stdin → single Python call maps events to CESP categories (`session.start`, `task.complete`, `input.required`, `user.spam`, etc.) → picks a sound (no-repeat logic) → shell plays audio async and optionally sends desktop notification.

### Multi-IDE Adapters

- **`adapters/codex.sh`** — Translates OpenAI Codex events to CESP JSON
- **`adapters/cursor.sh`** — Translates Cursor events to CESP JSON
- **`adapters/opencode.sh`** — Installer for OpenCode adapter
- **`adapters/opencode/peon-ping.ts`** — Full TypeScript CESP plugin for OpenCode IDE

All adapters translate IDE-specific events into the standardized CESP JSON format that `peon.sh` expects.

### Platform Audio Backends

- **macOS:** `afplay`
- **WSL2:** PowerShell `MediaPlayer`
- **Linux:** priority chain: `pw-play` → `paplay` → `ffplay` → `mpv` → `play` (SoX) → `aplay` (each with different volume scaling)

### State Management

`.state.json` persists across invocations: agent session tracking (suppresses sounds in delegate mode), pack rotation index, prompt timestamps (for annoyed easter egg), last-played sounds (no-repeat), and stop debouncing.

### Pack System

Packs use `openpeon.json` ([CESP v1.0](https://github.com/PeonPing/openpeon)) manifests with dotted categories mapping to arrays of `{ "file": "sound.wav", "label": "text" }` entries. Packs are downloaded at install time from the [OpenPeon registry](https://github.com/PeonPing/registry) into `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/packs/`. The registry `index.json` contains `source_repo`, `source_ref`, and `source_path` fields pointing to each pack's source (official packs in og-packs, community packs in contributor repos).

## Testing

Tests use [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) (Bash Automated Testing System). Test setup (`tests/setup.bash`) creates isolated temp directories with mock audio backends, manifests, and config so tests never touch real state. Key mock: `afplay` is replaced with a script that logs calls instead of playing audio.

CI runs on macOS (`macos-latest`) via GitHub Actions.

## Skills

Two Claude Code skills live in `skills/`:
- `/peon-ping-toggle` — Mute/unmute sounds
- `/peon-ping-config` — Modify any peon-ping setting (volume, packs, categories, etc.)

## Website

`docs/` contains the static landing page ([peonping.com](https://peonping.com)), deployed via Vercel. A `vercel.json` in `docs/` provides the `/install` redirect so `curl -fsSL peonping.com/install | bash` works. `video/` is a separate Remotion project for promotional videos (React + TypeScript, independent from the main codebase).
